**Special Case Validation for 195385 (_Settlement_Layout_2):**
- CV "File Processing Statistics by Day" for Wednesday: "Wed | 32 | 37 | 39"
- Only 7 files received, all with lag -1 (files for Tuesday, uploaded Wednesday), which is normal per CV ("Upload Lag Days Mode: -1" for Wed).
- Upload times (08:08–08:09 UTC) are within the expected window ("08:00:00–09:00:00 UTC").
- However, the low file count is not normal for a Wednesday (mean 32 files). This is a missing files issue, not a timing or lag anomaly.

**Summary:**  
All "All Good" sources delivered the expected files and volumes for Wednesday, September 10, 2025.  
All flagged incidents are based strictly on the CV's day-of-week file expectations and timing rules.  
No false positives: only true deviations from the CV are reported.
